Hello, my name is Nikolas McPhail (or Nik as most people call me). I 
am a recent graduate from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. 
I studied in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering.

Through college, I learned how to write in C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, 
SQL, C#, Python, as well as your standard algorithms and data structures. I 
took classes which allowed me to work in a group setting, as well as individually 
to strengthen my work ethic in both instances. In my free time I also work on 
passion projects of mine, whether they end up working or not.

Besides programming, I also have a greater passion for film and photography. My 
dream in life is to be a professional screenwriter/director. I have a Sony camera 
that I used to shoot photographs, and hope to start filming my own short films starting 
in 2025.

In my time at Charlotte, I met people who encompassed both of my passions and grew a 
network filled with friends that I hope can help me achieve my dreams. This website serves 
as a portfolio for both of my passions, as well as a blog post for any relevant information 
I want to blab about through text. If you are viewing this, I am glad you're here and you get 
something from my portfoliog.

Bye now.
